## Development

If you want to contribute to Avatar-CLI's development with your own time, you
can read the
[contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/avatar-cli/avatar-cli/-/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Although the repository is mirrored in
[Github](https://github.com/avatar-cli/avatar-cli), the development is tracked
in [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/avatar-cli/avatar-cli).

It's worth mentioning that besides the project itself, we also maintain a
the [AIPs repository](https://gitlab.com/avatar-cli/aips) (Avatar Improvement
Proposals) where we define the guiding principles and rules of Avatar-CLI's
development.

In general terms, you can take a look to
[all of our repositories](https://gitlab.com/avatar-cli), we appreciate code
contributions in all fronts.

## Reporting issues

Reporting problems with accurate descriptions is also a very important task in
software development. It helps to improve software quality and to improve the
user experience.

If you discover any issue, you can report it in our
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/avatar-cli/avatar-cli/-/issues).

## Sponsorship

As you can imagine, developing an application as complex as Avatar-CLI requires
a lot of time and effort.

If you don't have the time or the skills to contribute with your code but you
still want to help us, you have the option to sponsor its development. This
will allow us to devote more time to it, so you can have a better product in the
end.

For now there are four ways you can choose to sponsor Avatar-CLI:
