This week has been devoted mostly to website development and documentation,
but there are other minor non-web points too.

## Community

- We applied to include the project in the
  [Community Bridge](https://communitybridge.org) initiative.
- We applied too for the
  [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/), in
  part because being part of it is a requirement for the first one.

We applied to these two initiatives in part to gain visibility, but mainly to
stay in touch with the community. This is important to keep contact with
other development groups, learn from them, and understand how we can 
collaborate in order to have a better software ecosystem.

## Website

- Added favicon

### Blog

- Added missing pagination links inside the blog.
- Added missing reference to the Atom feed.
