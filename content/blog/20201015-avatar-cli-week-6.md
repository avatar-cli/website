## Catching up again

As you can see, there is a gap in the series of weekly posts about Avatar-CLI
development (there was a
[second weekly update](https://slack-files.com/TBUA4NSQZ-F01AQJWSY94-825524c273),
but I decided to not port it to this blog).

From now on we'll go back to the weekly schedule.

## New Release (v0.18.1)

This release is quite boring, it only features dependencies' upgrades.

## New website

We finally have a website for the Avatar-CLI project. The site structure has not
been finished yet (at the time of writing this blog post), but it's already
online.

To create this new site we used [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) + the
[Juice theme](https://www.getzola.org/themes/juice/), and we are deploying it to
[Gitlab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/).

## Community

Although the community is still very small and the activity is quite low, we
opened a new Reddit channel ([/r/Avatar_CLI](https://reddit.com/r/Avatar-CLI))
to ease informal asynchronous communication.
