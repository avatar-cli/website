## Catching up again

As you can see, there is a gap in the series of weekly posts about Avatar-CLI
development (there was a
[second weekly update](https://slack-files.com/TBUA4NSQZ-F01AQJWSY94-825524c273),
but I decided to not port it to this blog).

From now on we'll go back to the weekly schedule.

## New website

We finally have a website for the Avatar-CLI project. The site structure has not
been finished yet (at the time of writing this blog post), but it's already
online.

To create this new site we used [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and we are
deploying it to [Gitlab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/).
